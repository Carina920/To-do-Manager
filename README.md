# To-do-Manager

In this project, I learned by myself about using Spring Boot and React to develop a full-stack application for users to record to-do lists. During this project, I established the back-end using Spring Boot and interacted with MySQL through JPA entities and Hibernate. In order to secure the REST API by Spring Boot, I also added authentication, so that the users can log in by entering the correct user id and passwords. 

- The coding part is in the 'master' branch.
