# To-do-Manager
A Udemy course called 'Go Java Full Stack with Spring Boot and React'.

## Description
In this project, I learned by myself about using Spring Boot and React to develop a full-stack application for users to record to-do lists. During this project, I established the back-end using Spring Boot and interacted with MySQL through JPA entities and Hibernate. In order to secure the REST API by Spring Boot, I also added authentication, so that the users can log in by entering the correct user id and passwords. 

PS: The coding part is in the 'Coding' branch.
