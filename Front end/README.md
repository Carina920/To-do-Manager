## Description

As our Front-end for this project, I implemented login and welcome components with React and used Bootstrap to create a menu with navigation links.

### Create React App

1. cd to the file where you want to create a React application
2. npx create-react-app my-app
3. cd my-app
4. npm start
5. open the application: http://localhost:3000/

### Application Design in JS

1. Add 8 different functional components for the application.
2. Import Bootstrap.
3. Use Axios to store userâ€™s authentication token.
4. Design RESTful services with GET, DELETE, PUT, and POST methods for further Back-end.
